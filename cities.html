        <p>
          I was born in California, then had moved to Houston then Fort Drum given my father being in the military. After that I moved to Johnstown, and later ended up enlisting. This had brought me to Lackland (Disneyland), Baltimore for my first  and second assignments, then back to San Antonio (it is much nicer out of the training context). I am now located in Colorado Springs.

        I have some friends in Las Vegas that I'd like to visit whilst there. Austrailia, as well as London, have always seemed interesting as well.
